	abstract = {The tilt–translation ambiguity occurs because acceleration due to translation cannot be differentiated from gravitational acceleration. Head tilt can occur independent of body tilt which further complicates the problem. The tilt–translation ambiguity is examined for fore-aft (surge) translation with head and/or body orientations that are tilted in pitch 10° forward or backward. Eleven human subjects (six female), mean age 40 years participated. Conditions included no tilt (NT), head and body tilt (HBT), head only tilt (HOT), and body only tilt (BOT). The fore-aft stimulus consisted of a 2 s (0.5 Hz) sine wave in acceleration which a maximum peak velocity of 10 cm/s. After each stimulus, the subject reported the direction of motion as forward or backward. Subsequent stimuli were adjusted to determine the point at which subjects were equally likely to report motion in either direction. During the HBT, responses were biased such that upward pitch caused a neutral stimulus to be more likely to be perceived as forward and downward pitch caused the stimulus to be more likely to be perceived as backward. The difference in the point of subjective equality based on the direction of tilt was 3.3 cm/s. During the BOT condition, the bias with respect to the direction of body tilt was in a similar direction with a difference in PSE 1.6 cm/s. During HOT and NT, there was no significant bias on fore-aft perception. These findings demonstrate that body tilt shifts the PSE of fore-aft direction discrimination while head tilt has no influence.},

	abstract = {A general theme in sensory perception is that exposure to a stimulus makes it seem more neutral such that perception of subsequent stimuli is shifted in the opposite direction. The visual motion aftereffect (MAE) is an extensively studied example of this. Although similar effects have been described in other sensory systems, it has not previously been described in the vestibular system. Velocity storage has been extensively studied in the vestibular system and suggests a persistence of perception in the direction of the initial movement. The current study sought to determine how motion perception is influenced by prior movement in darkness. Thirteen human subjects (mean age 41, range 21–68) underwent whole-body fore–aft translation. The threshold of vestibular motion discrimination perception was measured using a single interval (1I) of motion lasting 0.5 s in which subjects identified their direction of motion as forward or backward using an adaptive staircase. The translation aftereffect (TAE) was measured in 2-interval (2I) experiments: The adapting stimulus moved 15 cm in 1.5 s (peak velocity 20 cm/s, peak acceleration 42 cm/s2). After a fixed inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 3 s, a second stimulus lasting 0.5 s was delivered and the subject identified the perceived direction of the second test stimulus. The test stimulus was determined using an adaptive staircase. The ISI was constant within the block, but adapting stimuli directions were randomly interleaved. During the 1I condition, the response bias was near zero in all subjects. With a 2I stimulus, 8 of 13 subjects demonstrated a significant bias. At an ISI of 0.5 s, a minority of subjects demonstrated a bias in the same direction as the adapter. When the ISI was 1, 1.5, or 3 s, all subjects who demonstrated a significant TAE had one in the opposite direction of the adapter, similar to that seen for MAE. When averaged across subjects, the TAE was significant with ISIs of 1.0 s and above. These findings demonstrate that perception of vestibular stimuli depends on prior motion. This has important implications for understanding and quantifying vestibular perception.},

	abstract = {Thresholds and biases of human motion perception were determined for yaw rotation and sway (left-right) and surge (fore-aft) translation, independently and in combination. Stimuli were 1 Hz sinusoid in acceleration with a peak velocity of 14°/s or cm/s. Test stimuli were adjusted based on prior responses, whereas the distracting stimulus was constant. Seventeen human subjects between the ages of 20 and 83 completed the experiments and were divided into 2 groups: younger and older than 50. Both sway and surge translation thresholds significantly increased when combined with yaw rotation. Rotation thresholds were not significantly increased by the presence of translation. The presence of a yaw distractor significantly biased perception of sway translation, such that during 14°/s leftward rotation, the point of subjective equality (PSE) occurred with sway of 3.2 ± 0.7 (mean ± SE) cm/s to the right. Likewise, during 14°/s rightward motion, the PSE was with sway of 2.9 ± 0.7 cm/s to the left. A sway distractor did not bias rotation perception. When subjects were asked to report the direction of translation while varying the axis of yaw rotation, the PSE at which translation was equally likely to be perceived in either direction was 29 ± 11 cm anterior to the midline. These results demonstrated that rotation biased translation perception, such that it is minimized when rotating about an axis anterior to the head. Since the combination of translation and rotation during ambulation is consistent with an axis anterior to the head, this may reflect a mechanism by which movements outside the pattern that occurs during ambulation are perceived.},

	abstract = {In many sensory systems, perception of stimuli is influenced by previous stimulus exposure such that subsequent stimuli may be perceived as more neutral. This phenomenon is known as an aftereffect and has been studied for vision, audition, and some vestibular stimuli including roll and translation. Previous data on yaw rotation perception has focused on low-frequency stimuli on the order of a minute which may not be directly applicable to frequencies during ambulation. The aim of the current study is to look at the influence of yaw rotation on subsequent perception near 1 Hz, the predominant frequency of yaw rotation during human ambulation. Humans were rotated with 12 ° whole body adapting stimulus over 1 or 1.5 s. After an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 3 s, a test stimulus the same duration as the adapting stimulus was presented, and subjects pushed a button to identify the direction of the test stimulus as right or left. The direction and magnitude of the test stimulus was adjusted based on prior responses to find the stimulus at which no rotation was perceived. Experiments were conducted both in darkness and with a visual fixation point. The presence of a fixation point did not influence the aftereffect which was largest at 0.5 s with an average size of 0.78 ± 0.18 °/s (mean ± SE). The aftereffect diminished with a time constant of {\textasciitilde}1 s. Thresholds were elevated after the adapting stimulus and also decreased with a time constant of {\textasciitilde}1 s. These findings demonstrate that short adapting stimuli can induce significant aftereffects in yaw rotation perception and that these aftereffects are independent from the previously described velocity storage.},

	abstract = {Detection of asymmetries has been a mainstay of using vestibular reflexes to assess semicircular canal function. However, there has been relatively little work on how vestibular stimuli are perceived. Suprathreshold vestibular perception was measured in 13 normal healthy controls by having them compare the relative sizes of two yaw (vertical-axis rotation) or sway (right–left translation) stimuli. Both stimuli were 1.5 s in duration with a staircase used to adjust the relative size of the stimuli to find a pair of stimuli perceived as equal. Motion stimuli were delivered in darkness using a hexapod motion platform, and visual stimuli simulating motion were presented on a screen in the absence of platform motion. Both same direction (SD) and opposite direction (OD) stimuli were delivered in separate runs. After a two-interval stimulus, subjects reported which movement they perceived as larger. Cumulative distribution functions were fit to the responses so that the relative magnitudes of the two stimuli perceived as equal could be determined. For OD trial blocks, a directional asymmetry index was calculated to compare the relative size of perceived rightward and leftward motion. For all trial blocks, a temporal asymmetry index (TAI) was used to compare the relative size of the first and second intervals. Motion OD stimuli were perceived as equal in all subjects in yaw and all but one in sway. For visual OD stimuli, two subjects had slightly asymmetric responses for both sway and yaw. The TAI demonstrated asymmetry in 54 \% in yaw, in which the second interval was perceived to be larger in all but one subject who had an asymmetry. For sway, only two subjects had a significant asymmetry. Visual stimuli produced a similar rate of asymmetry. The direction and magnitude of these asymmetries were not significantly correlated with those seen for motion stimuli. Asymmetries were found in a fraction with the TAI in SD stimuli for motion in yaw (42 \%) and sway (33 \%), as well as for vision in yaw (60 \%) and sway (43 \%). The precision at discriminating SD motion stimuli decreased significantly with age, but there was no difference in OD motion or visual stimuli.},

	abstract = {After exposure to a moving sensory stimulus, subsequent perception is often biased in the opposite direction. This phenomenon, known as an aftereffect, has been extensively studied for optic flow stimuli where it is known as the visual motion aftereffect (MAE). Such visual motion can also generate the sensation of self-motion or vection. It has recently been demonstrated that fore-aft translation in darkness also produces an aftereffect. The current study examines the interaction between visual MAE and vestibular translation aftereffects. Human subjects participated in a two-interval experiment in which the first interval (adapter) was visual, translation, or both combined congruently or in conflict. Subjects identified the direction of the second (test) interval of either visual or translation using a forced-choice technique. The translation adapter had no influence on visual test stimulus perception, and the visual adapter did not influence vestibular test stimulus perception in any subjects. However, congruent visual and translation induced a significantly larger perceptual bias on the translation test stimulus than was observed for a translation only adapter. The congruent adapter caused the MAE to be diminished relative to a visual only adapter. Conflicting visual and vestibular adapters produced an aftereffect similar to that seen when the single adapting stimulus was the same modality as the test stimulus. These results suggest that unlike visual and translation stimuli whose combined influence on perception can be predicted based on the effects of each stimulus individually, the effects of combined visual and translation stimuli on aftereffects cannot be predicted from the influences of each stimulus individually.},

	abstract = {There is strong evidence of shared neurophysiological substrates for visual and vestibular processing that likely support our capacity for estimating our own movement through the environment [1, 2]. We examined behavioral consequences of these shared substrates in the form of crossmodal aftereffects. In particular, we examined whether sustained exposure to a visual self-motion stimulus (i.e., optic flow) induces a subsequent bias in nonvisual (i.e., vestibular) self-motion perception in the opposite direction in darkness. Although several previous studies have investigated self-motion aftereffects [3–6], none have demonstrated crossmodal transfer, which is the strongest proof that the adapted mechanisms are generalized for self-motion processing. The crossmodal aftereffect was quantified using a motion-nulling procedure in which observers were physically translated on a motion platform to find the movement required to cancel the visually induced aftereffect. Crossmodal transfer was elicited only with the longest-duration visual adaptor (15 s), suggesting that transfer requires sustained vection (i.e., visually induced self-motion perception). Visual-only aftereffects were also measured, but the magnitudes of visual-only and crossmodal aftereffects were not correlated, indicating distinct underlying mechanisms. We propose that crossmodal aftereffects can be understood as an example of contingent [7] or contextual adaptation [8, 9] that arises in response to correlations across signals and functions to reduce these correlations in order to increase coding efficiency. According to this view, crossmodal aftereffects in general (e.g., visual-auditory [10] or visual-tactile [11]) can be explained as accidental manifestations of mechanisms that constantly function to calibrate sensory modalities with each other as well as with the environment.},

	abstract = {A moving visual field can induce the feeling of self-motion or vection. Illusory motion from static repeated asymmetric patterns creates a compelling visual motion stimulus, but it is unclear if such illusory motion can induce a feeling of self-motion or alter self-motion perception. In these experiments, human subjects reported the perceived direction of self-motion for sway translation and yaw rotation at the end of a period of viewing set visual stimuli coordinated with varying inertial stimuli. This tested the hypothesis that illusory visual motion would influence self-motion perception in the horizontal plane. Trials were arranged into 5 blocks based on stimulus type: moving star field with yaw rotation, moving star field with sway translation, illusory motion with yaw, illusory motion with sway, and static arrows with sway. Static arrows were used to evaluate the effect of cognitive suggestion on self-motion perception. Each trial had a control condition; the illusory motion controls were altered versions of the experimental image, which removed the illusory motion effect. For the moving visual stimulus, controls were carried out in a dark room. With the arrow visual stimulus, controls were a gray screen. In blocks containing a visual stimulus there was an 8s viewing interval with the inertial stimulus occurring over the final 1s. This allowed measurement of the visual illusion perception using objective methods. When no visual stimulus was present, only the 1s motion stimulus was presented. Eight women and five men (mean age 37) participated. To assess for a shift in self-motion perception, the effect of each visual stimulus on the self-motion stimulus (cm/s) at which subjects were equally likely to report motion in either direction was measured. Significant effects were seen for moving star fields for both translation (p = 0.001) and rotation (p{\textless}0.001), and arrows (p = 0.02). For the visual motion stimuli, inertial motion perception was shifted in the direction consistent with the visual stimulus. Arrows had a small effect on self-motion perception driven by a minority of subjects. There was no significant effect of illusory motion on self-motion perception for either translation or rotation (p{\textgreater}0.1 for both). Thus, although a true moving visual field can induce self-motion, results of this study show that illusory motion does not.},

Such phenomenon is known as aftereffect and has been extensively described in the visual system as well as recently described for the vestibular system during translation. It is known from aviation studies that after a maneuver in roll, pilots can experience a false perception of roll in the opposite direction. The magnitude and duration of this effect as well as the potential influence of the gravity vector have not previously been defined. In the current paper this roll aftereffect (RAE) is examined in response to whole-body roll about an earth-horizontal axis in eight healthy human subjects. The peak velocity of a 0.5-s-duration roll was varied based on previous responses to find the point where subjects perceived no motion. Without a preceding stimulus, the starting position (upright, 9° left, or 9° right) did not influence roll perception. The RAE was measured in a completely dark room using an adapting (first interval) stimulus consisting of 9° of roll over 1.5 s (peak velocity, 12°/s), delivered 0.5, 3, or 6 s prior to test (second interval) stimulus. A significant RAE was seen in all subjects. Half a second after the adapting stimulus, a test stimulus had to be on average 1.5 ± 0.4°/s in the opposite direction to be perceived as stationary. When the subject remained upright after the adapting stimulus, the RAE diminished with time, although it remained significantly larger at 3 and 6 s when the subject remained tilted after the adapting stimulus. These data demonstrate that roll perception can be influenced by small preceding stimuli and tilt causes a persistence of the RAE.},

To limit the review length, we focus most of this review on human findings. Animal findings, which are extensively reviewed elsewhere, are included when beneficial or necessary. We attempt to put these various findings and data sets, which can appear to be unrelated in the absence of a formal dynamic analysis, into context using published models. Specifically, by adding appropriate dynamic mechanisms (e.g., high-pass filters) to existing models, it appears that a number of otherwise seemingly disparate findings from the literature might be explained. One hypothesis that arises through this dynamic analysis is that decision making includes phasic (high pass) neural mechanisms, an evidence accumulator and/or some sort of midtrial decision-making mechanism (e.g., peak detector and/or decision boundary).},

Motion stimuli consisted of single cycles of sinusoidal acceleration and were generated by a motion platform. An adaptive two-alternative categorical forced-choice procedure was used. The subjects had to indicate by button presses whether they perceived yaw rotation to the left or to the right. Thresholds were measured using a 3-down, 1-up staircase paradigm. Mean yaw rotation velocity thresholds were 2.8 deg s(-1) for 0.05 Hz, 2.5 deg s(-1) for 0.1 Hz, 1.7 deg s(-1) for 0.2 Hz, 0.7 deg s(-1) for 0.5 Hz, 0.6 deg s(-1) for 1 Hz, 0.4 deg s(-1) for 2 Hz, and 0.6 deg s(-1) for 5 Hz. The results show that motion thresholds increase at 0.2 Hz and below and plateau at 0.5 Hz and above. Increasing velocity thresholds at lower frequencies qualitatively mimic the high-pass characteristics of the semicircular canals, since the increase at 0.2 Hz and below would be consistent with decreased gain/sensitivity observed in the VOR at lower frequencies. In fact, the measured dynamics are consistent with a high pass filter having a threshold plateau of 0.71 deg s(-1) and a cut-off frequency of 0.23 Hz, which corresponds to a time constant of approximately 0.70 s.

The attitude of most of these aircraft prior to impact was nose-low and with excessive bank, i.e., greater than 90 degrees . Prior to these accidents, each aircraft was noted as either changing heading or making an abrupt roll.
HYPOTHESIS: Could there be some underlying tendency for the pilot to make unnoticed stick inputs after completing a roll from one bank angle to another?
METHODS: Since ground-based flight simulators cannot create the true sensation of rolling an aircraft from one side to the other, the instrumented CALSPAN NT-33 aircraft was used for this study. Six pilots were given a series of three roll rates and two head positions while the aircraft automatically changed bank from 45 degrees of bank in one direction to 45 degrees of bank in the opposite direction. The subject's view of the external visual scene was restricted with a blue-amber vision restricting transparency combination. All attitude-indicating instruments were blanked, requiring the subjects to make stick inputs based on their vestibular (somatosensory) feedback.
RESULTS: Subjects experienced a consistent tendency to increase bank angle after given control of the aircraft immediately following the roll maneuver, while thinking they were maintaining a constant bank angle. In some cases, the pilots rolled the aircraft completely inverted.
CONCLUSION: When pilots rely on their perception of bank, following a roll, they will inadvertently increase their bank in the direction of the previous roll.},

	abstract = {While moving through the environment, our central nervous system accumulates sensory information over time to provide an estimate of our self-motion, allowing for completing crucial tasks such as maintaining balance. However, little is known on how the duration of the motion stimuli influences our performances in a self-motion discrimination task. Here we study the human ability to discriminate intensities of sinusoidal (0.5 Hz) self-rotations around the vertical axis (yaw) for four different stimulus durations (1, 2, 3 and 5 s) in darkness. In a typical trial, participants experienced two consecutive rotations of equal duration and different peak amplitude, and reported the one perceived as stronger. For each stimulus duration, we determined the smallest detectable change in stimulus intensity (differential threshold) for a reference velocity of 15 deg/s. Results indicate that differential thresholds decrease with stimulus duration and asymptotically converge to a constant, positive value. This suggests that the central nervous system accumulates sensory information on self-motion over time, resulting in improved discrimination performances. Observed trends in differential thresholds are consistent with predictions based on a drift diffusion model with leaky integration of sensory evidence.},
